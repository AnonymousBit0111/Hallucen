# Hallucen

Hallucen is a rendering engine in its early phase.It`s aim is to be simple and easy to use yet still powerful. Hallucen is still in its infancy so is not viable yet. Any pull requests are highly welcomed.


## Building

`scons` is used as the build system and everything is packed into this github repository (definetely not because im not aware of any better, more effective way to do this)
